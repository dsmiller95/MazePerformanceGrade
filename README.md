# Maze performance grader

simple godot project to learn godot. the idea is you manually solve a maze, then your solve path is played back.

You are graded based on how your solve compares to several AI solvers.




## Weird

This is coded by someone with 7 years C# experience, 4 years Unity experience. 
Part of the point of this repo is to learn GDScript! So when I see something weird,
I'll tag it with `#WEIRD` .
Usually these are features I'm used to in C# but aren't quite there in GDScript.
