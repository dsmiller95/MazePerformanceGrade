# Maze Performance Grade

This is a simple godot project, build to learn godot.
The goal is to solve a maze in fewer steps than any of the AIs.
After solving the maze, you see your route played back along with a few AIs routes to solve the maze.

The game logic is re-implemented in GDScript, C#, and Rust.
All of the source files have rough equivalents in the other 2 languages, and
hopefully this makes it easier to compare and contrast between the three.

## Weird

This is coded by someone with 7 years C# experience, 4 years Unity experience. 
The point of this repo is to learn GDScript, Rust, and Godots integrations with them!

So when I see something weird, I'll tag it with `#WEIRD` .
Usually these are features I'm used to in C# missing from GDscript, 
or something which feels a little awkward in Rust.
